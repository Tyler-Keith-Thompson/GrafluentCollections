# GrafluentCollections: notes for coding agents

GrafluentCollections is a library of graph-shaped collections for Swift: balanced search trees,
tries, suffix structures, decision diagrams and the other data structures whose shape is a tree or
a graph, built on Grafluent's protocols and tree types. It optimizes for one thing: generic code
that runs at the speed of a hand-written loop over arrays, with value semantics (copy-on-write
structs) and the API shape of the standard library and Swift Collections. Its users are Swift
developers on Apple platforms, Linux and WebAssembly who need a sorted set, a trie or a suffix
structure, and Grafluent users who want to run graph algorithms over one. The charter in
`.kanban/triage.md` says what is in and out of scope; the backlog holds the planned structures.
`BinarySearchTrees` (`AVLTree`, `AVLDictionary`, `RedBlackTree`, `Treap`, `SplayTree`), `BTrees`
(`BTree`, `BTreeDictionary`), `SkipLists` (`SkipList`), `Tries` (`Trie`,
`TrieDictionary`, `RadixTree`, `RadixTreeDictionary`, `AhoCorasickAutomaton`), `SuffixStructures` (`SuffixArray`, `SuffixTree`, `SuffixAutomaton`), `DecisionDiagrams` (`BinaryDecisionDiagram`, `ZeroSuppressedDecisionDiagram`), `RangeTrees` (`FenwickTree`, `SegmentTree`, `LazySegmentTree`, `IntervalTree`), `SpatialTrees` (`KDTree`, `Quadtree`, `Octree`), `Ropes` (`Rope`) and `PersistentTrees` (`PersistentTreeSet`, `PersistentTreeDictionary`) have landed and set the pattern for the rest: a structure, its Grafluent conversion, tests, a
ratio test and benchmarks. Swift 6.3 (minimum).
Bazel is the development build; SwiftPM is the published package. `README.md` is the user-facing
overview.

This file came from a project template. Sections marked *default* describe how the owner likes
every project built; delete a rule only when it cannot apply here, and say so in the commit.

## Layout

```
Sources/<Module>/                One directory per module, each with a generated BUILD.bazel
Sources/GrafluentCollections/             Umbrella module (@_exported imports) and the landing DocC catalog
Tests/<Module>Tests/             One test target per module; Performance/ holds speed-reliant tests
Tests/GrafluentCollectionsTests/          The README examples, verbatim
Tests/GrafluentCollectionsTestSupport/    Shared test fixtures (data only)
scripts/modules.py               The module graph
tools/                           Bazel rule wrappers (warnings as errors, Swift 6 mode), DocC rules
```

`Benchmarks/` is a separate SwiftPM package (ordo-one/benchmark) that Bazel ignores; see
`Benchmarks/README.md`.

### Module graph

`scripts/modules.py` is the source of truth for modules, their dependencies, test targets,
external packages and platforms. `just modules` regenerates `Package.swift`, every `BUILD.bazel`,
the umbrella module and `swift/Package.swift` from it. Never edit the generated files by hand;
`//:package_swift_test` fails when `Package.swift` disagrees with the Bazel graph.

- Add a module: a row in `MODULES` (name, group, description, dependencies), then `just modules`.
- Add a test target: a row in `TEST_TARGETS`. A target with a `Performance/` directory of Swift
  sources must be listed in `PERFORMANCE_TESTS`, and the reverse.
- Add an executable: a row in `EXECUTABLES` (name, description, dependencies). It holds only
  `@main`; its code lives in a module, where tests reach it.
- Add an external package: a row in `PACKAGES`, its `swiftpkg_<identity>` repository in
  `MODULE.bazel`'s `use_repo`, then `just modules` and `just resolve`.
- Generate mocks: uncomment the Mockable row in `PACKAGES`, add `mockable/Mockable` to the
  module that declares the protocol and to its test target, add `swiftpkg_mockable` to
  `use_repo`, then `just modules` and `just resolve`. The generator defines `MOCKING` for that
  module in debug builds only, in both build systems.
- A module name takes a `Module` suffix only when it would otherwise equal its main type's name
  (`AVLTreeModule` would hold `AVLTree`). No catch-all modules ("Core", "Utilities").

## Commands

Every shell command gets a timeout. macOS has no `timeout`; use
`perl -e 'alarm 1800; exec @ARGV' <command>`. A bug can make a loop run forever.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `just build` / `just test` | Build / test everything (debug) |
| `bazel test //Tests/XTests` | One test target (`just test-one //Tests/XTests`) |
| `just filter <pattern>` | Tests whose name matches |
| `just test-release` | `--config=release`: builds and runs only the `XPerformanceTests` targets |
| `just spm-test`, `just verify` | SwiftPM tests; both build systems |
| `just modules` | Regenerate build files from `scripts/modules.py` |
| `just resolve` | Re-resolve Bazel's SwiftPM dependencies after editing `PACKAGES` |
| `just bench [--target X]` | Benchmarks; `just bench-compare` against the `main` baseline |
| `just bench-simulated-compare [--target X]` | Simulated counts (Callgrind in a Linux VM, from `~/workspace/BenchmarkHarness`) against the committed `simulated` baseline; `just bench-simulated [--target X]` re-records it |
| `just docs` | Combined DocC site into `.build/docs` |
| `just generate` | Xcode project from the Bazel graph |
| `just template-update` | Merge the project template's changes since `.template.json`'s commit; resolve conflicts, then `just modules`, `just test` |
| `bazel query 'rdeps(//Tests/..., //Sources/X)'` | Test targets affected by a change to X |

- Debug is the default configuration. Every test target except the `XPerformanceTests` ones is
  tagged `debug-only`, which `--config=release` filters out.
- A test that bounds wall-clock time, or runs a large input under `.timeLimit`, belongs in
  `Tests/X/Performance/`.
- Release builds use their own output base (see the justfile). Don't create other output bases
  or copies of the repo, and shut down any extra Bazel server you start.
- Run suites through Bazel, not `swift test --filter`.
- First-party warnings are errors (`tools/swift_rules.bzl`); dependencies build quietly. Fix the
  warning, never suppress it.

## Building blocks

The owner's own libraries, first in line under "Don't reinvent the wheel" (House rules). Reach
for them before writing a graph, a container or an operator chain by hand, and before adding a
third-party package for the same job. Add one as a row in `PACKAGES` (`scripts/modules.py`).

| Library | What it is | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| [Grafluent](https://github.com/Tyler-Keith-Thompson/Grafluent) | A generic, high-performance graph library: copy-on-write representations (`AdjacencyList`, `CompressedSparseRow`, `AdjacencyMatrix`, pseudographs, stable graphs), graph classes with invariants (`DirectedAcyclicGraph`, `BipartiteGraph`, `Tree`) and algorithms (traversal, shortest paths, flows, matching, connectivity, isomorphism, layout) | Anything shaped like a graph or DAG: dependency orderings, scheduling, routing, state machines, reachability. Products are per module (`.product(name: "ShortestPaths", package: "Grafluent")`); the umbrella is `Grafluent`. |
| [DependencyInjection](https://github.com/Tyler-Keith-Thompson/DependencyInjection) | Swift 6 dependency injection: `Factory` values on `Container`, `@Injected` / `@LazyInjected` / `@ConstructorInjected`, unique, cached and shared scopes, hierarchical containers, and `withTestContainer` so concurrent tests never share state | Any seam a test needs to replace (clocks, network, storage). Tests wrap their body in `withTestContainer { }` and register doubles there. Product `DependencyInjection`. |
| [Afluent](https://github.com/Tyler-Keith-Thompson/Afluent) | Reactive operators over async/await: `DeferredTask` (a unit of work that yields one value) and `AsyncSequence` extensions with Combine's names (`map`, `flatMap`, `catch`, `retry`, `debounce`, `share`, …), plus `AfluentTesting` | Pipelines over async work where Combine would once have been used; a Combine replacement in new code. Products `Afluent` and, for test targets, `AfluentTesting`. |

Their conventions carry over: value types, typed errors, `checked:` spellings that throw where
the plain spelling traps, tests with Swift Testing.

## Workflow

### Adding a feature

A feature is done when it has all of these. Copy what its sibling features in the module already
have.

1. **Code and docs.** The implementation, with doc comments per "Docs" below. A new module gets a
   row in `scripts/modules.py`, then `just modules`, the README's module table and the umbrella
   DocC catalog's topic list.
2. **Tests** in `Tests/<Module>Tests`:
   - hand-worked cases;
   - edge cases: empty input, one element, the boundaries of every range;
   - `checked:` spellings and their errors;
   - exit tests for every trap;
   - a property test against a naive reference (`swift-property-based`).
3. **A README example**, if the feature changes how the package is introduced, copied verbatim
   into `Tests/GrafluentCollectionsTests`.
4. **A benchmark** in `Benchmarks/Benchmarks/<Module>Benchmarks` where speed matters, starting
   with a `BASELINE` entry: the hand-written form the code must keep pace with. Measure in
   release, and add a ratio test in `Tests/<Module>Tests/Performance/` where siblings have one.
   Use small inputs in debug builds, because the timing only runs in release.
   Judge a speed change by `just bench-simulated-compare --target <Module>Benchmarks`: its
   instruction, cache-miss and branch counts don't move when the machine is busy, as wall clock
   does. Allocation counts and absolute times still come from `just bench`, on a quiet machine.
   Re-record the `simulated` baseline for the targets a change touches
   (`just bench-simulated --target X`) and commit it with the change.

Watch for these:

- A closure inside `#expect` nested in another closure can run the wrong body, or crash the
  Linux compiler. Put the body in a nested `func`.
- Hoist literals to typed `let`s rather than writing them inline in `#expect`.
- Iterate dictionary keys sorted wherever order is visible.

### What to run

| Change | Run |
|---|---|
| Any library code | `bazel test` for every target in `bazel query 'rdeps(//Tests/..., //Sources/X)'`, then `just test-release` |
| `scripts/modules.py` | `just modules`, `just test` (which runs `//:package_swift_test`), `just spm` |
| `Benchmarks/`, or an API the benchmarks call | `cd Benchmarks && env -u TOOLCHAINS xcrun --toolchain default swift build -c release` |
| A change meant to be faster | `just bench-simulated-compare --target <Module>Benchmarks`, not `just bench-compare` |

### Before a push

Every push to `main` releases a patch version, and CI minutes are scarce, so batch pushes.

1. Verify the committed state in a clean worktree: `bazel test //...` in debug, then
   `--config=release`.
2. Watch the Release and DocC workflows to green, and fix anything that breaks.
3. Don't add CI steps that rebuild without the owner's approval.

## House rules

### Code (*default*)

- **Declarative and composable.** Describe what a value is, not the steps that build it. Prefer
  small types and functions that compose (modifiers returning a new value, result builders,
  protocol extensions) over flags, configuration objects and long imperative bodies. A caller
  should be able to read an expression top to bottom and know the result.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** If the Swift ecosystem already has it, use it. Before writing a
  data structure, algorithm, parser, concurrency primitive or test tool, look in this order:
  1. The owner's libraries (Building blocks above).
  2. Apple: the standard library and Foundation, then Apple's open-source packages
     (swift-collections, swift-algorithms, swift-async-algorithms, swift-numerics, swift-atomics,
     swift-system, swift-argument-parser, swift-log, swift-crypto, swift-nio), then
     the platform frameworks where every target, Linux CI included, has them.
  3. Well-maintained community packages (Mockable and swift-property-based are already the
     picks for mocks and property tests).

  Write it yourself only when nothing fits: the package can't support the platforms, can't meet
  a measured performance need, or would pull in far more than the job needs. Say which package
  was rejected and why in the commit message.
- Public types are value types. Mutation returns a new value or is a clearly named `mutating`
  method; no shared mutable state reached through globals.
- Use the standard library's `Atomic`/`Mutex` or swift-atomics for shared state. No hand-rolled
  atomics.
- Names come from established libraries or the literature, familiar programmer terms first.
  Never invent names. No synonym typealiases; one name per concept. Spell names out.
- Delete unused API rather than keeping it.
- No hooks or SPI added only for tests.
- Underscored Swift features (`@_spi`, `_modify`, `@_effects`, `@_exported`) are fine where they
  help. Apple private API is not: undocumented framework symbols, private selectors, private
  frameworks, anything App Review rejects.

### Tests (*default*)

- Swift Testing (`import Testing`, `@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`). Never XCTest.
- Each test is self-contained and portable: no assertion or setup helpers, not DRY; a test
  copied to another file still works. Shared fixture data in `GrafluentCollectionsTestSupport` is tolerated;
  shared assertions are not.
- Test names state the rule they pin ("The checked spelling throws EmptyName for an empty name").
- Tests may call underscored and `package` API.
- Test doubles come from [Mockable](https://github.com/Kolos65/Mockable): mark the protocol at the
  seam `@Mockable` and use the generated `Mock<Protocol>` with `given`, `when` and `verify`
  inside the test, rather than hand-writing doubles. With DependencyInjection, register the mock
  inside the test's `withTestContainer { }`. Mocks exist only in debug builds, so a
  `PerformanceTests` target never uses one.
- Property tests use swift-property-based (`import PropertyBased`, `propertyCheck`).
- Randomized tests are seeded (`SeededRandomNumberGenerator`) so a failure reproduces from its
  seed alone.

### Docs (*default*)

- Describe the current API. No history ("previously", "renamed"), design debates, comparisons
  with other libraries, or benchmark numbers in doc comments or READMEs. Complexity bounds are
  fine.
- Doc comments: a one-line summary, then parameters, return value, complexity, and what traps or
  throws.
- The README's examples are tests (`Tests/GrafluentCollectionsTests`).

### Git (*default*)

- Commit message style: `[main] - <summary>`, no trailers (no co-author or session lines).
- One commit per finished feature or fix, after its suites pass.
- Never file bugs with third-party projects; record them locally.

## API conventions (*default*)

### Errors

- **Plain spellings trap** on a precondition failure, like an `Array` subscript. They are the
  fast path.
- **`checked:` spellings throw** a typed, payload-free error. There are no nil-returning
  variants beside them; `try?` gives `nil`. Where the standard library's collections already
  return an optional (`Set.remove`, `Dictionary` subscripts, `min`), follow the standard library.
- **Invariant-breaking mutations throw on the plain spelling** and change nothing, with one typed
  error per invariant whose cases make a single `catch` exhaustive.
- **Queries whose failure is the answer return a witness** (`findCycle() -> Cycle?`), not an
  error.

### Shapes

- Results are dedicated types, not tuples.
- Lazy views end in `View`; the materialized form drops the suffix.
- Materializing operations are static factories on a target the caller picks.

### Performance patterns

- Public types are copy-on-write structs, `@frozen`, with `@usableFromInline` internals.
- Tree vertices live in flat arrays indexed by `Int32` or `Int`, never as a class per vertex;
  links are indices, −1 for none. Rebalancing recurses only to the height, or uses an explicit
  stack.
- A conversion to a Grafluent type (`BinaryTree(tree)`, `Arborescence(tree)`) is an initializer on
  the Grafluent type and costs O(n) once; the collection's own operations never go through it.
  Hot generic code is `@inlinable`; parameters are `some` generics, never `any`.
- Copy-on-write: the uniqueness check is inlined and the reallocation slow path is
  `@inline(never)`. Bulk mutations check uniqueness once, outside the loop.
- Traps measured in past projects: nested functions capturing mutable locals (boxed, retained
  per step); generic iterators stored in arrays (use integer cursors); reading a struct out of a
  class property (copies and retains); lazy maps capturing `self`.
- Write overflow guards as comparisons (`x <= Int.max / 4`), not a discarded
  `multipliedReportingOverflow` result.
